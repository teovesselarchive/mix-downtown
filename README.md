# MIX Downtown

A complete responsive website design concept for MIX Downtown, prepared for Vessel Archive. This is an independent redesign study; the official restaurant website remains https://www.mixdowntown.net/.

## Run locally

No build tools or package installation required. From this folder run:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Open http://localhost:8000 . All local paths are relative, including for GitHub project hosting. The site is also portable to static hosting.

## Included

- Original homepage design, complete official menu directory, gallery, private events, visit and reservation routes.
- Every current branch with separate hours, phone, directions and booking links.
- Official ordering, social, event and legal destinations preserved.
- Accessible mobile navigation, keyboard photo gallery, native FAQ disclosures and reduced-motion support.
- Self-hosted fonts with licenses; responsive WebP photos with unchanged originals and provenance.
- Research and source audit in `data/`; product and design documentation.

## Content and publication

Facts were checked November 5, 2026. Menu prices, hours, promotions, availability and booking terms can change. Transactions and inquiries are handled by the restaurant’s existing services; this static site does not collect or send visitor data. Google Maps images were used for atmosphere research only and are not bundled.

This public repository is a reviewable design concept, not an official business launch. It uses `noindex,nofollow`. Before a business launch, obtain client approval and image/brand rights, verify all business details and link destinations, replace concept metadata, and set the final canonical URL. Image provenance is not a transfer of copyright.

## Editing

Edit the HTML pages directly. Shared styles are in `assets/styles.css`, interactions in `assets/app.js`, and sources in `data/venue-facts.json` / `data/image-sources.json`. No credentials, analytics, or database are included.
